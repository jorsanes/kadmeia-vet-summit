# Amsterdam Animal Hospital: End-to-End Process Automation

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Amsterdam Animal Hospital (AAH)  
**Sector:** Large-scale veterinary hospital  
**Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands  
**Scale:** 150+ staff, 45 veterinarians, 3 locations  
**Project Duration:** 8 months  
**Investment:** €85,000  

## The Challenge: Scaling Complex Operations

Amsterdam Animal Hospital, one of Europe's largest veterinary facilities, was struggling to maintain operational efficiency as it rapidly expanded from 2 to 3 locations while doubling its staff size.

### Operational Complexity

#### Multi-Location Coordination
- 🏢 **3 facilities** with inconsistent processes
- 👥 **150+ staff members** across different shifts and specialties  
- 📊 **8,500+ cases monthly** with complex case routing
- 🔄 **Manual handoffs** between departments and locations
- 📋 **Paper-based protocols** causing delays and errors

#### Administrative Burden
- ⏰ **35% of staff time** spent on administrative tasks
- 📞 **1,200+ phone calls daily** for appointments and follow-ups
- 📝 **Manual data entry** across 12+ systems
- 💾 **Data silos** preventing holistic patient view
- 🧾 **Invoice processing delays** averaging 8-12 days

#### Quality and Compliance Issues
- 📋 **Inconsistent documentation** across locations
- ⚠️ **Compliance gaps** in medical record keeping
- 🔍 **Manual audit processes** taking 40+ hours monthly
- 📊 **Limited real-time visibility** into operations
- 🎯 **Quality metrics** not systematically tracked

### Financial Impact Pre-Automation

| Challenge Area | Cost Impact | Time Impact | Quality Impact |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Administrative overhead** | €45,000/month | 280 hours/day | Medium |
| **Manual processes** | €32,000/month | 180 hours/day | High |
| **Communication gaps** | €18,000/month | 95 hours/day | High |
| **Compliance management** | €12,000/month | 65 hours/day | Critical |

> "We were growing rapidly but drowning in manual processes. Every new location added exponential complexity instead of linear growth" - **Dr. Anna van der Berg, CEO**

## The KADMEIA Solution: Comprehensive Automation Ecosystem

We designed and implemented a hospital-wide automation platform that seamlessly connects all departments, locations, and external partners in a unified digital ecosystem.
